```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Problem 1
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

* The `instacart` dataset contains `r nrow(instacart)` rows and `r ncol(instacart)` columns; Key variables include `user_id`, `product_name`, `order_number`, `order_dow`, `order_hour_of_day` and so on. Every observation illustrates the product name, its order time, user's relevant ordering information, its belonging aisle and department.

```{r}
instacart_1 =
  instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

head(instacart_1,10) %>% 
knitr::kable()
```

**There are `r nrow(instacart_1)` aisles there and `fresh vegetables` and `fresh fruits` aisles are the most items ordered from.
