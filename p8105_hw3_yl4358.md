# Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

  - The `instacart` dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns; Key
    variables include `user_id`, `product_name`, `order_number`,
    `order_dow`, `order_hour_of_day` and so on. Every observation
    illustrates the product name, its order time, userâ€™s relevant
    ordering information, its belonging aisle and department.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart_1 =
  instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

head(instacart_1,10) %>% 
knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                         |      n |
| :---------------------------- | -----: |
| fresh vegetables              | 150609 |
| fresh fruits                  | 150473 |
| packaged vegetables fruits    |  78493 |
| yogurt                        |  55240 |
| packaged cheese               |  41699 |
| water seltzer sparkling water |  36617 |
| milk                          |  32644 |
| chips pretzels                |  31269 |
| soy lactosefree               |  26240 |
| bread                         |  23635 |

  - There are 134 aisles there and `fresh vegetables` and `fresh fruits`
    aisles are the most items ordered from.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart_2 =
  instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  filter(n >= 10000) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "coral") + 
  labs(
    title = "The number of items ordered in each aisle",
    x = "Aisle ",
    y = "The number of items ordered"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5))
instacart_2
```

  - We use bar chart to display the number of items ordered in each
    aisle, they are quite different among aisles. As we can see, fresh
    fruits aisle and fresh vegetables aisle are aisles most items
    ordered from. Plot is so clear and straightforward that we could get
    information from it.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart_3 =
  instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | aisle == "dog food care" | aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(min_rank(desc(n)) == 1) %>% 
  rename(most_popular_items = product_name, ordering_counts = n) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
instacart_3
```

| aisle                      | most\_popular\_items                          | ordering\_counts |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---------------: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |              499 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |               30 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          |             9784 |

  - Concluded from the table, most popular items in `baking ingredient`,
    `dog food care` and `packaged vegetables fruits` aisle are
    respectively `light brown sugar`, `snack sticks chicken & rice
    recipe dog treats` and `organic baby spinach`.

    mean_hour_of_the_day = round(mean(order_hour_of_day), digits = 1)
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "order_dow",
    values_from = "mean_hour_of_the_day"
  ) %>%
  rename( Monday = '0', Tuesday = '1', Wednesday = '2', Thursday = '3', Friday = '4', Saturday = '5', Sunday = '6') %>% 
  knitr::kable()

instacart_4
```

| product\_name    | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
| :--------------- | -----: | ------: | --------: | -------: | -----: | -------: | -----: |
| Coffee Ice Cream |   13.8 |    14.3 |      15.4 |     15.3 |   15.2 |     12.3 |   13.8 |
| Pink Lady Apples |   13.4 |    11.4 |      11.7 |     14.2 |   11.6 |     12.8 |   11.9 |

  - People are more likely to order `Coffee Ice Cream` during
    12:00pm-15:00pm which is teatime and order `Pink Lady Apples` during
    11:00am to 14:00 pm when having lunch.

    have low data value among locations in NY state.
